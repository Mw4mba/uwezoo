---

## 🔧 All Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: Handle Duplicate Company Creation (Employers)

**Problem:** When an employer tried to set up their role a second time (or after page refresh), they got a 409 error because the company already existed.

**Solution:** Check if company exists before inserting, update if it does:

```typescript
// First check if user already has a company
const { data: existingCompany } = await supabase
  .from('companies')
  .select('id')
  .eq('owner_id', user.id)
  .maybeSingle();

if (existingCompany) {
  // Update existing company
  await supabase.from('companies').update({ ... }).eq('id', existingCompany.id);
} else {
  // Create new company
  await supabase.from('companies').insert({ ... });
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

---

### Fix #2: Clean Up Old Company Data (Role Switching)

**Problem:** When users switched from "employer" to "independent" or "employee", their old company data remained in the database, causing 409 conflicts.

**Solution:** Delete old company data when switching away from employer role:

```typescript
// If switching away from employer, clean up old company data
if (selectedRole !== "employer") {
  console.log('🧹 Role Selection: Cleaning up company data for non-employer role');
  
  const { error: deleteError } = await supabase
    .from('companies')
    .delete()
    .eq('owner_id', user.id);
  
  if (deleteError && deleteError.code !== 'PGRST116') {
    console.warn('⚠️ Could not delete old company:', deleteError);
    // Don't throw - continue with role change anyway
  }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

---

### Fix #3: Enhanced Error Messages

**Problem:** Users saw generic "Failed to set up role" messages that didn't explain what went wrong.

**Solution:** Added specific error messages based on error codes:

```typescript
if (err.code === '23505') {
  errorMsg = "A company with this name already exists. Please choose a different name.";
} else if (err.code === '23503') {
  errorMsg = "Database reference error. Please contact support.";
} else if (err.message) {
  errorMsg = `Error: ${err.message}`;
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

### Fix #4: Comprehensive Logging

**Problem:** Hard to debug what was happening during role selection.

**Solution:** Added detailed logging at every step:

```typescript
console.log('🎯 Role Selection: Starting submission...');
console.log('📝 Role Selection: Updating user profile with role:', selectedRole);
console.log('🧹 Role Selection: Cleaning up company data...');
console.log('🏢 Role Selection: Handling employer company creation...');
console.log('✅ Role Selection: Profile updated successfully');
console.log('🎉 Role Selection: All operations complete');
```

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

If errors still occur:

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
Look for emoji-prefixed logs to track progress:
- 🎯 = Starting
- 📝 = Updating
- 🧹 = Cleaning
- 🏢 = Company operations
- ✅ = Success
- ❌ = Error

### Step 2: Check Network Tab
- Look for failed requests (red, status 409/404/500)
- Check request payload
- Check response body

### Step 3: Check Database
Run these SQL queries in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check user's current role and company data
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = 'user-id-here';

-- Check if user has a company
SELECT * FROM companies WHERE owner_id = 'user-id-here';

-- Check for orphaned company data
SELECT * FROM user_profiles 
WHERE role != 'employer' 
  AND company_name IS NOT NULL;
```
