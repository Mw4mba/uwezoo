# Uwezo Career Platform - Schema Analysis & Role-Based Implementation

## 📊 Current vs Enhanced Schema Comparison

### **Current Schema Issues:**
1. **Limited Multi-Company Support**: Original schema doesn't properly support employers having multiple companies
2. **Basic Role Management**: Simple role field without advanced permissions
3. **Incomplete Application Workflow**: Missing assessment, interview, and offer management
4. **No Independent Contractor Features**: Missing project proposals and client contracts
5. **Limited Analytics**: No performance tracking or reporting capabilities

### **Enhanced Schema Improvements:**

| Feature | Current | Enhanced | Impact |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Multi-Company Support** | ❌ Single company per user | ✅ Multiple companies via `company_members` table | Employers can manage multiple businesses |
| **Role Permissions** | ❌ Basic role field | ✅ Granular role-based permissions | Fine-grained access control |
| **Application Workflow** | ❌ Simple status tracking | ✅ Complete hiring pipeline with stages | Professional recruitment process |
| **Assessment System** | ❌ Basic quiz system | ✅ Comprehensive skill assessments | Better candidate evaluation |
| **Contract Management** | ❌ Simple templates | ✅ Digital signatures & legal compliance | Professional contract handling |
| **Independent Features** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Project proposals & client contracts | Full freelancer support |
| **Analytics & Reporting** | ❌ Limited tracking | ✅ Comprehensive metrics & insights | Data-driven decisions |
