# Role Protection Implementation

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive role-based access control to ensure users must select a role before accessing protected pages, and users are automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role.

## Changes Made

### 1. Protected Layout (`app/protected/layout.tsx`)

**Enhanced Role Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Checks both `role_selected` AND `role` value (not just `role_selected`)
- ‚úÖ Redirects users without a role to `/protected` (role selection page)
- ‚úÖ Redirects users from role-specific pages back to role selection if role is undefined
- ‚úÖ Prevents access to employee/employer/profile pages without a valid role

**Logic Flow:**
```typescript
if (profile?.role_selected && profile?.role) {
  // User has a valid role - allow access
  setUserRole(profile.role);
  setRoleSelected(true);
  // Redirect to appropriate dashboard if on /protected
} else {
  // No role or role not selected - force role selection
  setRoleSelected(false);
  setUserRole(null);
  
  // Redirect from role-specific pages to /protected
  if (on employee/employer/profile page) {
    router.replace('/protected');
  }
}
```

**Console Logging:**
- `‚ö†Ô∏è ProtectedLayout: Role not selected or undefined, showing role selection`
- `üîÄ ProtectedLayout: Redirecting to role selection from role-specific page`

### 2. Employee Dashboard (`app/protected/employee\page.tsx`)

**Added Role Guard:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const checkUserRole = async () => {
    // Get user profile
    const { data: profile } = await supabase
      .from('user_profiles')
      .select('role, role_selected')
      .eq('user_id', user.id)
      .maybeSingle();

    // Redirect if no role
    if (!profile || !profile.role_selected || !profile.role) {
      router.replace('/protected');
      return;
    }

    // Redirect if employer trying to access employee page
    if (profile.role === 'employer') {
      router.replace('/protected/employer');
      return;
    }
  };
}, [user, router]);
```

**Protection:**
- ‚úÖ Users without a role are redirected to role selection
- ‚úÖ Employers accessing this page are redirected to employer dashboard
- ‚úÖ Only employees and independents can access this page

### 3. Employer Dashboard (`app/protected/employer/page.tsx`)

**Added Role Guard:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const checkUserRole = async () => {
    // Get user profile
    const { data: profile } = await supabase
      .from('user_profiles')
      .select('role, role_selected')
      .eq('user_id', user.id)
      .maybeSingle();

    // Redirect if no role
    if (!profile || !profile.role_selected || !profile.role) {
      router.replace('/protected');
      return;
    }

    // Redirect if employee trying to access employer page
    if (profile.role === 'employee' || profile.role === 'independent') {
      router.replace('/protected/employee');
      return;
    }
  };
}, [user, router]);
```

**Protection:**
- ‚úÖ Users without a role are redirected to role selection
- ‚úÖ Employees accessing this page are redirected to employee dashboard
- ‚úÖ Only employers can access this page

### 4. Profile Page (`app/protected/profile/page.tsx`)

**Added Role Guard:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const checkUserRole = async () => {
    // Get user profile
    const { data: profile } = await supabase
      .from('user_profiles')
      .select('role, role_selected')
      .eq('user_id', user.id)
      .maybeSingle();

    // Redirect if no role
    if (!profile || !profile.role_selected || !profile.role) {
      router.replace('/protected');
    }
  };
}, [user, router]);
```

**Protection:**
- ‚úÖ Users without a role are redirected to role selection
- ‚úÖ Profile page accessible after role selection

## User Flow

### New User (No Role)
1. User signs up/logs in
2. Redirected to `/protected`
3. Sees role selection component
4. Selects role (employee/employer/independent)
5. Redirected to appropriate dashboard
6. Can access all protected features

### Existing User (Has Role)
1. User logs in
2. Role verified automatically
3. Redirected to appropriate dashboard
4. Full access to their role-specific pages

### User Without Role Trying to Access Protected Pages
**Scenario 1: Direct URL Access**
- User types `/protected/employee` in browser
- No role detected
- Redirected to `/protected` (role selection)

**Scenario 2: Bookmarked Page**
- User bookmarks `/protected/employer`
- Role becomes undefined/unselected
- Redirected to `/protected` (role selection)

**Scenario 3: Wrong Role Access**
- Employee tries to access `/protected/employer`
- Detected as wrong role
- Redirected to `/protected/employee`

## Security Benefits

1. **Double Protection**: Both layout-level and page-level checks
2. **Consistent Redirects**: All pages redirect to same role selection
3. **Role Validation**: Checks both `role_selected` AND `role` value
4. **Cross-Role Prevention**: Employees can't access employer pages and vice versa
5. **Debug Visibility**: Console logs show all redirect decisions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New user sees role selection immediately
- [ ] User cannot access `/protected/employee` without role
- [ ] User cannot access `/protected/employer` without role
- [ ] User cannot access `/protected/profile` without role
- [ ] Employee cannot access employer dashboard
- [ ] Employer cannot access employee dashboard
- [ ] After role selection, user is redirected correctly
- [ ] Browser back button doesn't bypass role selection
- [ ] Direct URL typing redirects properly
- [ ] Console shows proper logging for debugging

## Database Requirements

The protection relies on the `user_profiles` table having:
- `role` column (TEXT)
- `role_selected` column (BOOLEAN)

Make sure to execute `SUPABASE_FIX.sql` to ensure proper table structure.

## Console Logging

All role checks now log their decisions:
- `‚ö†Ô∏è [Page]: No role selected, redirecting to role selection`
- `üîÄ [Page]: User is [role], redirecting to [dashboard]`
- `‚úÖ [Page]: User verified as [role]`
- `‚ùå [Page]: Error checking user role`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy changes** to production
2. **Test role selection** with new users
3. **Verify redirects** work as expected
4. **Monitor console logs** for any issues
5. **Execute SQL fix** if not already done
